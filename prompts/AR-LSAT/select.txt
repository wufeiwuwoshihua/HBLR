You are given a **Constraint Optimization (CO)** task that includes the following fixed structure:
* A **Domain** section defining the scope of the task (e.g., performance slots 1–5)
* A **Variables** section listing decision variables and their domains (e.g., position assignments for each student)
* A **Constraints** section that encodes rules as both **CO logic expressions** and their corresponding **natural language** descriptions
* A **Queries for Options** section presenting multiple possible variable assignments, each labeled A–E, and described in both **natural language orderings** and their corresponding **variable assignments**

### Your Task:
Only analyze the **Constraints** and **Queries for Options** sections.
For each **CO + NL pair** within those sections:
1. If the **CO expression accurately and completely captures** the meaning of the NL description — with no mismatch, omission, or ambiguity — output the **CO constraint or assignment only**, prefixed with `[CO]`.
2. If the CO expression **does not exactly match** the NL description, due to logical differences or translation errors, output the **natural language sentence instead**, prefixed with `[NL]`.

The **Domain** and **Variables** sections must be left **unchanged and untouched**.


### Example CO Task Input (Excerpt):

#### Constraints
* **Ginny Before Fernando**:

  * Ginny\_position < Fernando\_position

* **Kevin Before Hakim and Juanita**:

  * Kevin\_position < Hakim\_position
  * Kevin\_position < Juanita\_position

* **Hakim Either Immediately Before or After Fernando**:

  * |Hakim\_position - Fernando\_position| = 1

* **Unique Performance Slots**:

  * Each student (Fernando, Ginny, Hakim, Juanita, and Kevin) is assigned a unique position \[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]...

#### Queries for Options

* **A) Ginny, Fernando, Hakim, Kevin, Juanita**

  * Ginny\_position = 1, Fernando\_position = 2, Hakim\_position = 3, Kevin\_position = 4, Juanita\_position = 5
* ...


### Output Format:

Your output must follow the structure:
## Domain
<original Domain block>

## Variables
<original Variables block>

## Constraints
[CO] Ginny_position < Fernando_position ::: Ginny Before Fernando
[NL] Kevin performs before either Hakim or Juanita  
[CO] |Hakim_position - Fernando_position| = 1 ::: Hakim Either Immediately Before or After Fernando
[NL] Each student is assigned a unique time slot between 1 and 5 

## Queries for Options
[CO] A) Ginny_position = 1, Fernando_position = 2, Hakim_position = 3, Kevin_position = 4, Juanita_position = 5  ::: Ginny, Fernando, Hakim, Kevin, Juanita
[NL] B) Ginny performs before Juanita, then Kevin, then Hakim, then Fernando  
...


### Notes:

* When you choose [CO], keep the NL right after it, but when you choose NL, throw the CO away
* Do not modify Domain or Variables sections
* Do not add extra comments or reasoning in your output
* Do not add extra comments or reasoning in your output
